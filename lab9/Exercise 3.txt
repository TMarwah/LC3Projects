ex3q1:
There is one call to the puts Subroutine

ex3q2:
Yes, the call is only written once, but using
JMP allows for the loop to happen

ex3q3:
Now puts is called 3 times

ex3q4:
No

ex3q5:
I see 5 calls

ex3q6:
When the value is 6 the loop stops being unrolled

ex3q7:
Half is unrolled (10 puts calls), 
then the whole thing is recalled

The puts subroutine is now called 10 times

There is a jump instruction present in the new code
